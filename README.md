# Crystal Collector Game

**Developer: Andrea Minhas**

**Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery**

The Crystal Collector Game is a front end application in which the objective is for the user to try to reach the random number that the computer generates by clicking the crystals. The value of the crystals is hidden until the user clicks on them. Once the value of the crystal will be added to the user's total score. If the user can match their total score to the random number they will win and the game will reset. If they guess a number that is higher than the number that was generated, this will count as a loss and the game will reset.
